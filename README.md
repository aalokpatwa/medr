# medr - Medical Surveys Response Predictor
Aalok Patwa, Archbishop Mitty High School, San Jose, CA

Presented to Stanford University

In most hospital settings, patients are given surveys in which there are multiple questions on the page, each with multiple-choice answers. Patients circle the answer for each question. 
The goal is to automate the reading of such survey responses. Every patient has his/her own style of circling the answer. 
The survey responses are scanned and in the process of scanning, shift, rotation and resolution variations are introduced. 
There are variable number of questions on each page and variable number of choices for each question. 

Program's input and output

Given a directory of TIFF Scans of Survey Responses, prepare a CSV file medr_predictions.csv
with predicted responses.
